    "Online peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces rely heavily on trust between users, and platforms like Airbnb are no exception. Because guests cannot physically visit a property before booking, they depend largely on host-provided listing descriptions, photos, and amenities to form expectations about their stay. Expectation–confirmation theory (ECT), developed by Oliver and widely applied in hospitality contexts, models satisfaction as this comparison between prior expectations and perceived performance; negative disconfirmation (worse than expected) leads to dissatisfaction, while confirmation or positive disconfirmation leads to satisfaction.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) When guests' experiences deviate significantly from their expectations, the resulting expectation gap can lead to lower ratings, negative reviews, reduced future demand, and erosion of platform trust.<br><br>\n",
    "​\n",
    "Text‑mining work on Airbnb reviews shows what guests actually care about. Cheng and Jin analyze a large corpus of Airbnb review comments using topic modeling and sentiment analysis, finding that experiences are dominated by location, amenities, and host interaction, with a strong overall positivity bias in reviews.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Other work confirms that Airbnb reviews are overwhelmingly positive and that criticism is often muted, which makes star ratings alone a poor indicator of underlying problems.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectation disconfirmation has been explicitly studied in the Airbnb context: Zhang et al. show that mismatches between expectations and experience, and how consistent reviews are, meaningfully affect guest attitudes and intention to recommend listings.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Most directly related to this project, Cavique et al. measure semantic alignment between Airbnb host descriptions and guest reviews using word embeddings and clustering. They introduce a concept coverage ratio (how many review “concepts” are also present in the description) and find that higher coverage is generally associated with more positive review sentiment.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)<br><br>\n",
    "​\n",
    "Building on this work, the proposed project defines a new expectation disconfirmation score that combines global semantic similarity between descriptions and reviews with host–guest sentiment differences (capturing overpromising vs. underpromising). It then uses supervised models to predict this score from pre-booking information (descriptions, amenities, host and listing features). In a diverse tourism market like San Diego, where listings range from luxury beachfront villas in La Jolla to urban studios in Little Italy, the factors contributing to expectation gaps are multifaceted. By quantifying which listing characteristics predict smaller expectation gaps, this project aims to provide actionable insights for hosts to improve transparency and for platforms to better calibrate guest expectations.\n",

    "We predict that listings with superhost status, more amenities, and hosts who keep their descriptions more grounded will have smaller expectation disconfirmation. Lower expectation disconfirmation groups will have a higher booking frequency. Superhosts need to maintain a certain standard to keep their badge, so they're more likely to write honest descriptions. More amenities give hosts concrete things to describe rather than relying on vague hype, which helps set expectations that the listing can actually deliver on."

    "| Column | Description | Purpose |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| `description` | The host's written description of their place | We run VADER sentiment analysis on this to get the host-side sentiment score |\n",
    "| `host_is_superhost` | Superhost badge (t/f) | Predictor |\n",
    "| `price` | Nightly price (stored as a string with `$`, needs cleaning) | Predictor |\n",
    "| `neighbourhood_cleansed` | Neighborhood name | Predictor |\n",
    "| `room_type` | Entire home, private room, shared room, or hotel room | Predictor |\n",
    "| `amenities` | JSON list of amenities | We count these per listing and use the count as a predictor |\n",
    "| `review_scores_rating` | Overall guest rating (0–5) | Used to validate our gap metric |\n",
    "| `review_scores_accuracy` | Accuracy sub-score from guests | This is the closest existing metric to what our gap tries to capture |\n",
    "| `number_of_reviews` | Total review count | We use this to filter to only keep listings with 5+ reviews |\n",
    "| `reviews_per_month` | Avg reviews per month | Substitute for how often the listing gets booked |\n",
    "\n",
    "The key variables we use are `description` (the host's written listing text, which we sentiment-score), `host_is_superhost`,`price`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`, `room_type`, and `amenities` as predictor variables, along with `review_scores_rating` and `review_scores_accuracy` for validation. We will use `reviews_per_month` as a substitute for booking frequency. After we filter out listings that are missing a `description` or have fewer than 5 reviews in `number_of_reviews`, we're left with **9,091 listings** as usable observations. The superhost split is roughly 60/40, which gives us a solid basis for comparison.\n",

    "Our real datasets closely match the ideal. The main differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No direct booking data.** Airbnb does not publicly share booking counts, so we use `reviews_per_month` as a substitute for booking frequency, which is standard in Airbnb research but is an approximation.\n",
    "- **Single snapshot in time.** The data represents a single scrape (September 2025) rather than a longitudinal panel, so we cannot track how the Expectation Gap changes over time for a given listing.\n",
    "- **One city only.** Our analysis is limited to San Diego; findings may not generalize to other markets with different guest demographics or listing characteristics.\n",
    "- **Noisy reviews.** Some reviews are super short (\"Great stay!\") or written in other languages, which makes individual sentiment scores less reliable. But since we're averaging across multiple reviews per listing and requiring at least 5, aggregating across multiple reviews per listing mitigates this.\n",
    "\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them.

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "\n",
    "> While the information we are using is public and was put online by Airbnb users, they do not have a clear understanding that their data will be used in our project.\n",

    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The information we are collecting might reveal identifiable details about a listing so there might be a problem with listings being poorly anonymized, but the risk is not high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",

    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",

    "> A large majority of airbnb reviews are positive, especially if the listing is in a good area like San Diego, there might be a slight bias.\n",

    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",

    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
